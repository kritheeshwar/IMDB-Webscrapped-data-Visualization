1. Data Scraping
Using Python libraries like Selenium and BeautifulSoup, we scrape IMDb's top 250 TV shows page to extract relevant data such as rank, name, year, episodes, and rating.

2. Data Cleaning
We clean the scraped data to remove duplicates, correct errors, and handle missing values. This ensures the data is accurate and ready for analysis.

3. Data Analysis
We analyze the cleaned data to identify patterns, trends, and insights. This may involve statistical analysis, clustering, or other data analysis techniques.

4. Data Storage in SQL
The cleaned and analyzed data is stored in a SQL database. We create tables with appropriate data types to efficiently store the data.

5. Data Visualization in Power BI
Finally, we use Power BI to create interactive visualizations and dashboards. This allows us to present the insights in an easily understandable and visually appealing manner.
